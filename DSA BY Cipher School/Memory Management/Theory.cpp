// Allocation:- It is done by 2 method
/*

1.Static Memory allocation -(Compile Time)
2.Dynamic Memory allocation -(Run Time)

1. 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   int x;
   char ch;
   int a[100];
    return 0;
   - In SMA, size and location where variable
will be stored is fixed during compile time

- location: where: variables-will-be-stored:is-
saved, -but-the-actual-physical-is-NOT-
allocated: at~-compile-time, -but- at-runtimef.

- SMA is slightly faster tha DMA ,
- Allocation and deallocation that is done by compiler itself

}

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation

- DMA allows you to define memory requirement during execution
of program

- it uses heap memory for the same

- in DMA, “new” keyword is used to allocate memory, and “delete” keyword is used to deallocate Tea

- new keyeord return the address that has been allocated to
variable on the heap memory (during runtime)

int *p=new int j;


- allocation and deallocation is done by us


For Example

//allocate memory

Bice] glia sam Gu iG eal mi) e

uy

//Free the space
delete [Jarr;
